== Description ==
Fine tuning a WP setup by removing or adding options , just for easy updating setting on all my personal sites. If useful for someone else , use it :-)

Add form submission IP's to fail2ban for Contact Form 7 and WS Form PRO.
Log unkown user logins and wrong logins to fail2ban.

Change the layout of the login form if you add a logo file , background file can be uploaded to but only is used when the special logo is uploaded.

== Installation ==
This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/aati-wp-finetuning` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. no settings to change , all is hardcoded

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Upload loginlogo.png to /wp-content/uploads (montly upload folders are not supported) to change the wp logo and css 
Upload loginbackground.webp to /wp-content/uploads (montly upload folders are not supported) to activate the login background on the standard login page , only if you uploaded a logo

To change colors of the button : add folowing to Customizing Additional CSS

What's up next
* adding an admin page with the used values and display handy information instead of admin notices.
* maybe having a whitelist ip addresses that have access to /wp-json/wp/v2/users/ so that the rest of the api still works but is blocked to see users except for local IP and the server IP's itself and others. Needs testing and research.
